            <h3>Preamble</h3>
            <p>I could write a novel about the causes and effects in my life
                that moved me towards a career in software development. However,
                I can name three formative experiences/things that form a loose outline:
                <ol>
                    <li>Building and programming multiple Lego Mindstorms robots in elementary school;</li>
                    <li>Participating on an FRC team 5690 SubZero Robotics (see more on this below);</li>
                    <li>My father's love for asking questions, figuring out math, and reading Wikipedia.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>SubZero Robotics</h3>
            <p>I joined the high school robotics team on the recommendation of a friend, and this resulted in my first contact with real code.
                Real, ugly, functional code written by students just about as clueless as clueless comes (one of these students, a friend, is now a phenomenal programmer out in the private tech world).
                I learned the pain of trying to interpret poorly-documented code, though it wasn’t until later that I learned what good documentation looked like!
            </p>
            <p>
                We managed to build some great code, such as a system that interfaced with laser light detectors and conveyors to automatically manage a robot’s intake system.
                We also wrote computer vision code interfacing with a Limelight camera and the robot’s drivetrain to perform auto-alignment to game targets;
                this required a great deal of PID tuning and latency cutting, while the target finding system was largely plug and play minus a few vision-parameter tunings.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had an awful time learning C++ as a first language; I feel that I only truly learned to program when I entered college and purposefully studied Python.
                I wasted a lot of time trying to glean information off of esoteric C++ documentation instead of a well built tutorial designed for beginners.
                But I felt so much pressure to simply get functional code on the robot when it was needed, and failed to see the excellent value in spending “work time” on learning.
            </p>
            <p>
                This only scratches the surface of the many things I picked up on the robotics team, least of all leadership and communication techniques.
                But those are stories for another place (the miscellany page).
            </p>

            <h3>Where I'm (planning on) going</h3>
            <p><s>Aside from Scotland, home of my ancestors</s>
                I am chiefly interested in lower level development, whether that be embedded systems
                or OS/kernel development. Years of living with engineers and robots has drilled into
                me a certain love for the physical applications of the digital world.
            </p>

            <h3>All Hail C!</h3>
            <p>I really love programming in C; it gives me the high of feeling like
                I'm in control, while also being miles less painful than assembly. It's
                also mostly non-paradigmatic, not quite Object Oriented but certainly not
                functional. Instead, it provides an abstract interface to your machine's
                resources that is unbiased and transparent.
            </p>
            <p>Obviously, C isn't suited to all computing tasks; for everyday problem
                solving, I'm likely to default to Python (another favorite of mine).
                But Python can never scratch that certain need-to-know-what-and-why itch
                of mine like C can.
            </p>
