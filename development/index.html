    <h2>Software Development</h2>
    <h3>Preamble</h3>
    <p>I could write a novel about the causes and effects in my life
        that moved me towards a career in software development. However,
        I can name three formative experiences/things that form a loose outline:
        <ol>
            <li>Building and programming multiple Lego Mindstorms robots in elementary school;</li>
            <li>Participating on an FRC team (5690 SubZero Robotics);</li>
            <li>My father's love for asking questions, figuring out math, and reading Wikipedia.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/lmcwilliams135/drone_sim/general" title="Docker Hub">
            Drone simulation</a> built with C++ for web deployment</li>
        <li>Human/Robot interaction, vision research with UMN's 
            <a href="https://irvlab.cs.umn.edu/" title="IRVLab homepage">IRVLab</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://devpost.com/software/locomotive-vgufn5" title="DevPost page">
            TransitPal</a>, a web tool for tracking public transit usage</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Where I'm (planning on) going</h3>
    <p><s>Aside from Scotland, home of my ancestors</s>
        I am chiefly interested in lower level development, whether that be embedded systems
        or OS/kernel development. Years of living with engineers and robots has drilled into
        me a certain love for the physical applications of the digital world.
    </p>

    <h3>All Hail C!</h3>
    <p>I really love programming in C; it gives me the high of feeling like
        I'm in control, while also being miles less painful than assembly. It's
        also mostly non-paradigmatic, not quite Object Oriented but certainly not
        functional. Instead, it provides an abstract interface to your machine's
        resources that is unbiased and transparent.
    </p>
    <p>Obviously, C isn't suited to all computing tasks; for everyday problem
        solving, I'm likely to default to Python (another favorite of mine).
        But Python can never scratch that certain need-to-know-what-and-why itch
        of mine like C can.
