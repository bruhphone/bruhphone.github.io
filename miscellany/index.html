    <h3>A Motto</h3>
    <p>I think it's important to have guiding principles for your life. For me,
        that has been following Christ; I would highly recommend this route. Beyond that,
        I want to encapsulate my way of life into one sentence, an easily shareable,
        bite-sized manifesto. This is extremely reductive and somewhat stupid, but
        it's a good mental exercise and I think everyone should do it. Here's mine:
        <blockquote>
            Think, and live.
        </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p>It sounds overdramatic, but try this approach to living! It never fails.</p>
    <p>I plan on eventually populating this part of my page with some reading
        recommendations and favorite websites, as well as some more extremely
        deep think-pieces.
